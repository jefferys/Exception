# exception

Provides exception objects for use in an exception hierarchy, and a means of
stopping, warning, and messaging with these objects. By defining an explicit
hierarchy, catching and handling errors in groups becomes possible. Common
errors have default messages, with only meaningful parameters needed.

```{r}
library("exception")

nsfEx <- NoSuchFileException( path= "waldo.txt" )
class(nsfEx)

tryCatch(
   stopWith( nsfEx ),
   IOException= function(e) {print("Caught an IOException.")}
)
```
